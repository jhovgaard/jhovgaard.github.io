</a>

<p>I'm very proud to introduce you to my own very first product: <a href="http://servant.io" target="_blank">Servant for IIS</a>. <br /><br />
	I daily administrate around 10 webservers. Each of these servers is forcing me to remote connect to the server or setup remote 
	administration and install and configure both the client and server software. With different workstations I always end up hassling
	with VPN settings, client software etc. Personally I've never been a fan of "inetmgr", so I decided to stop whining and start contributing 
	to my favorite webserver.</p>

<p>Servant for IIS is a completely hassle-free way to administrate your IIS directly from your web browser.</p>

<p>I'll start by showing you how to install it and then demonstrate its basic features.</p>

<h2>Installation</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Go to <a href="http://www.servant.io" target="_blank">www.servant.io</a> and click the big green button to download the zip file.</li>
	<li>Login and copy the zip file to the server you want to install on.</li>
	<li>Extract all files from the zip to a desired folder. I'll go for <strong>C:\servant-1.0.1</strong>.</li>
	<li>Jump into the installation folder and double click the file <strong>Install Servant Service.bat</strong>. Servant will now install it self as a Windows Service called 
		<em>Servant for IIS</em>. If you want to uninstall it again, simply run the file <strong>Uninstall Servant Service.bat</strong>. If this gives you any problems, try 
		running "Servant.Server.exe install" from a command prompt as Administrator.</li>
	<li>A new browser window will automatically open. This is the installation wizard:<br>
	<div style="margin: 15px 0; font-size: 10pt;">
		<a href="/postfiles/servant_install_wizard.png" target="_blank"><img src="/postfiles/servant_install_wizard.png" class="intextimage"></a>
		<strong>URL of Servant</strong> is the URL you want Servant to be accessible from.
		<br />
		<strong>Username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> is the credentials you want to use to authenticate yourself. 
		<div class="clear"></div>
	</li>
	<li>When all fields is entered click the green button. This will save your configuration.</li>
	<li>The next screen leaves you only one button to click on: <em>Click here to login now</em></li>
	<li>Servant will now ask for your credentials and log you in - That's it! You can now log out of your server and access Servant from your desktop machine.</li>
</ol>

<h2>The home screen</h2>
<p>
	<a href="/postfiles/servant_home_screen.png" target="_blank"><img src="/postfiles/servant_home_screen.png" class="intextimage"></a>
	The home screen of Servant gives you a quick overview of the latest unhandled exceptions thrown by any of your sites. Clicking on the exception will redirect you to the 
	details/stack trace of the selected exception (we will get to exceptions later).
	<br /><br />
	Notice that all of your sites is available by clicking the Sites item in the menu to the left.
	<br /><br />
	If you're experiencing bugs, want new features or anything else there's a feedback button to the right of the screen.
</p>

<h2>Create new site</h2>
<p>
	<a href="/postfiles/servant_create_new_site.png"><img src="/postfiles/servant_create_new_site.png" class="intextimage"></a>
	By clicking on <strong>Create new</strong> under the menu's site section you'll be able to create a new website. Simply fill out all of the fields like when you create sites
	in the IIS Manager, and Servant will create the site and redirect you to the site's settings page. Simple as that!
</p>
<div class="clear"></div>

<h2>Site settings</h2>
<p>
	<a href="/postfiles/servant_site_settings.png"><img src="/postfiles/servant_site_settings.png" class="intextimage"></a>
	The site settings page give you direct access to the basic settings of a website.
	<br /><br />
	You can change name, bindings, site path and application pool. Also you can <strong>start/stop a site</strong>, <strong>restart the site</strong> or <strong>recycle 
	the application pool</strong> it's running on. Of course you can also <strong>delete the site</strong>.
	<br /><br />
	From this screen you can go to the errors screen from the top menu.

<h2>Site settings</h2>
<p>
	<a href="/postfiles/servant_site_errors.png" target="_blank"><img src="/postfiles/servant_site_errors.png" class="intextimage"></a>
	The site errors screen is powerful tool that quickly shows you all unhandled exceptions thrown by the selected website.
	<br /><br />
	The exception column is the message of the exception.<br />
	The timestamp column is the time since the exception thrown. By hovering over the text you'll get the UTC timestamp.
	<br />
	By clicking on the exception message you'll be redirected to the error details screen.

<br />
<p>That's all for now. Servant is not released as open source. There's a commercial edition on its way including awesome features like error monitoring, git publish and more.</p>
<p>I hope you like my product! I'm extremely excited about the release and would love to hear your feedback.</p>
<p><strong>So please drop a comment, are you going to try out Servant on your servers?</strong></p>
<p>
	Have a great day!
	<br />
	Jonas
