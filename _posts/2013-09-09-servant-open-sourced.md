Wauw, happy days! This was a biggy! I've decided to completely open-source my number 1 pet project, Servant for IIS, under the MIT license. This means that you can jump right to [https://github.com/jhovgaard/servant](https://github.com/jhovgaard/servant) and check out the source. You can of course fork your own version, make it more awesome and send me your pull request! 

I received a couple of questions regarding the open sourcing of Servant. I'll share my answers here:

**Was Servant initially meant to be monetized?**

Absolutely! I wanted to make a Pro edition and earn some cash that way. Unfortunately for my economy it felt wrong. I've never shared anything but my blog posts with the community, even that I got so much from it. Making money out of my first real project just felt bad so I decided to open source it instead.

**Does open sourcing Servant mean you'll stop supporting and developing it?**

Not at all. I'll continue to support and develop Servant like I used to. The only difference is that you guys can help me make it go a lot faster! :-)

So that's it! My first open-source project. I'm very excited about the future of Servant. I hope to see a lot of issues getting created and even some pull requests (that really would be awesome!).

Thanks for reading!

Jonas
